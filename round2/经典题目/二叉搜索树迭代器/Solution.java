    保持栈顶元素就是下一个要访问的元素
    We all know that, once you get to a TreeNode, in order to get the smallest, you need to go all the way down its left branch. So our first step is to point to pointer to the left most TreeNode. The problem is how to do back trace. Since the TreeNode doesn't have father pointer, we cannot get a TreeNode's father node in O(1) without store it beforehand. Back to the first step, when we are traversal to the left most TreeNode, we store each TreeNode we met ( They are all father nodes for back trace).

    After that, I try an example, for next(), I directly return where the pointer pointing at, which should be the left most TreeNode I previously found. What to do next? After returning the smallest TreeNode, I need to point the pointer to the next smallest TreeNode. When the current TreeNode has a right branch (It cannot have left branch, remember we traversal to the left most), we need to jump to its right child first and then traversal to its right child's left most TreeNode. When the current TreeNode doesn't have a right branch, it means there cannot be a node with value smaller than itself father node, point the pointer at its father node.
